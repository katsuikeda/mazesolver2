- `maze.py`: Contains the `Maze` class for maze generation and solving.
- `cell.py`: Defines the `Cell` class representing each maze cell.
- `graphics.py`: Provides basic graphics functionality using Tkinter.
- `tests.py`: Unit tests for the maze generation and solving logic.
- `main.sh`: Shell script to run the application.
- `test.sh`: Shell script to run the unit tests.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with standard Python installations)

## How to Run
